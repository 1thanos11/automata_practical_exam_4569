## Question 1 : DFA Equivalence Checker
Checks whether two given DFAs accept the same language using symmetric difference traversal.

### How to run:
- Call `dfa_equivalence(dfa1, dfa2)` with two DFA dictionaries.
- Each DFA should contain:
  - `alphabet`: list of input symbols
  - `start`: initial state
  - `accept`: list of accepting states
  - `transition`: nested dict for transitions (e.g. `{'q0': {'a': 'q1'}}`)

## Question 2 : CYK Algorithm for CFG in CNF
Implements the CYK algorithm to determine if a string can be generated by a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form.

### How to run:
- Call `cyk(cfg, string)` where:
  - `cfg` is a dictionary with non-terminals as keys and list of production strings as values.
  - `string` is the input string to check.

## Testing
See `test_main.py` for sample unit tests.
